## Undergraduate Student Researcher

**Location:** Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India

**Duration:** June 2019 - July 2020

**Lab:** Power Electronics Lab

**Department:** Department of Avionics

**University:** Indian Insitute of Space Science and Technology

**Advisor:** Dr. Rajeevan P P

**Project:** Series Reactive Power Compensation for Grid Connected Open-end Winding Induction Generation Systems for Wind Energy Applications

**Overview:** 
◦ A new series reactive power compensation scheme was proposed for a grid connected induction generator system where
it utilises both ends of the induction machine with one end of the winding connected to the grid and the other end
connected to a capacitor fed voltage source inverter which supplies the required reactive power for the excitation of the
induction generator.

◦ Performed extensive research, simulations, analysed the new proposed concept and designed a new current oriented
control scheme where active power is being delivered to the grid by the induction generator without drawing reactive
power from it.

◦ A grid connected open-end winding induction generator system with series reactive power compensation was first
simulated in PLECS 4.3.1 software and then implemented on hardware for experimental validation using a digital signal
processor (DSP TMS320F28335).

◦ A current oriented rotating reference frame based closed loop control scheme was implemented on hardware so that
active power gets delivered to the grid from the open-end winding induction generator without drawing any reactive
power from the grid for its excitation.

◦ The reactive power requirement for the excitation of induction generator is compensated by a capacitor-fed voltage source
inverter so that it reduces the burden on the grid to supply reactive power.

◦ The proposed model was simulated and studied for the dynamic case where the speed of the induction machine is
transient.

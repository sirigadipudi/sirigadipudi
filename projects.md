### Research at University of Washington:

_**Deep Reinforcement Learning Researcher, University of Washington**_

_Washington Embodied Intelligence and Robotics Development (WEIRD) Lab_

**Human-Guided Interventions for Reset-free Reinforcement Learning**
- Currently working on designing a novel methodology to introduce human-guided interventions for reset-free reinforcement learning algorithms to enable efficient autonomous robotic learning.

**Resilient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**
- Designed and demonstrated a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that addresses spurious variations in the environment for a manipulation task, achieving better and robust performance than other baseline algorithms. Paper submitted to NeurIPS 2023.

**Expertise in Deep Robotic Learning**
- Experienced in implementing deep RL algorithms for visual observations with a tracker module developed using object segmentation models like SAM and FC-CLIP, customizing them for object tracking, compared to other visual reward inference techniques.
- Successfully demonstrated manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm, employing both imitation learning (demos given through Oculus VR headset and data sampled using MongoDB). Also proficient in using OpenCV and Open3D libraries to implement object tracking for robot manipulation tasks.

## Projects: ##
**Implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms**
- Deep RL algorithms like SAC, PPO, Behvaior Cloning, Dreamer, etc, were implemented with both state and visual
observation based rewards in both simulation and on a real world robot arm for manipulation tasks.
- Visualized DQN agents’ decision making process using deep learning techniques: SmoothGrad-CAM, SmoothGrad-CAM++
and saliency maps, for Atari games, to interpret the ability of RL agents’ decision making and achieved 65% better
visualization with SmoothGrad-CAM++.

**Self-Supervised Learning for Image Classification**
- Implemented self-supervised learning techniques (SimCLR) for image classification. Analyzed the effectiveness of
self-supervised learning compared to supervised learning for image classification tasks.

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Generation**
- Implemented Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) from scratch, trained
them to generate unseen images and analyzed the quality of generated images from both models.

**Image Captioning with Various Architectures**
- Developed an image captioning system with Vanilla RNNs, Transformers, and LSTMs from scratch.
- Explored the strengths and limitations of each architecture in generating descriptive captions for images, and attained the best performance with Transformers than all the other architectures.

**Implementation of Advanced Deep Learning Algorithms**
- Implemented fully connected and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch for image classification.
- Incorporated normalization techniques such as batch normalization, layer normalization, and dropout for improved model performance. Developed network visualization techniques to analyze the learned representations.

**Implementation of Robotics Algorithms**
- Implemented localization algorithms, including Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter, to accurately estimate the robot’s position based on landmarks. Utilized Pybullet for visualization.
- Designed and implemented motion planning algorithms, such as A∗, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), and RRT∗ algorithms, from scratch, to plan paths for a robot arm and a non-holonomic car.

I am a graduate student pursuing Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering, at the University of Washington, Seattle.

My primary concentration is in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am also a Graduate Student Researcher at the [WEIRD lab](https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/) in Paul G Allen School of Computer Engineering, with my Advisor: [Prof. Abhishek Gupta](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/). My research work currently is in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Robotic Learning.

As a Scientist at the Indian Space Research Organization, where my research was focused on AI-driven solutions for Radars and Tracking. I worked at a Radar ground station in the launching port of India, where I was responsible for tracking low earth orbit satellites, GPS balloons, developing a data processing software to integrate and operate all subsystems of the Radar. I developed the skills of control systems design, GUI programming, ML, and data and signal processing. 

I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (with a specialization in Avionics) from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/). 

I had worked on projects related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Robotics and Reinforcement Learning. Check out my [projects](https://sirigadipudi.github.io/projects/).

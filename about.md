I am a graduate student pursuing Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering, at the University of Washington, Seattle.

My primary concentration is in the field of Machine Learning and Robotics. I am currently a Graduate Student Researcher at the [WEIRD lab](https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/) in Paul G Allen School of Computer Engineering, with my Advisor: [Prof. Abhishek Gupta](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/). My research work currently is in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Robotic Learning.

I am a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and as a committee member of the GradSWE committee at UW, I had organized several workshops for undergraduate students. I had also attended the SWE's WE'23 conference that happened in LA.

Prior to my Master's, I served as a Scientist at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), where my work was focused on AI-driven solutions for Radars and Tracking. My expertise in the role extended to real time operations and system design where I managed console operations for various ISRO missions and also executed different technology development projects like the development of the data processing software for the radar console and display.

I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (with a specialization in Avionics) from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/). 

I had worked on projects related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Robotics and Reinforcement Learning. Check out my [projects](https://sirigadipudi.github.io/projects/).

I am an avid reader. I read lots of classics and fictional novels. I am always up to chatting about books.
